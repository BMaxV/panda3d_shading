After struggling with shading in panda3d for some time, I decided to give it another go.

And hey, it's actually not that bad.

here is a GLSL spec [https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/specs/gl/GLSLangSpec.4.60.pdf](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/specs/gl/GLSLangSpec.4.60.pdf)

Here is the panda3d info that exists [https://docs.panda3d.org/1.10/python/programming/shaders/shader-basics](https://docs.panda3d.org/1.10/python/programming/shaders/shader-basics)
